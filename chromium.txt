got a simple test script to return content of example.com

using wallabag 2.4 cuz it's php 7
chromium-php requires php 7

tried using other wallabags, but not obvious how it works

wallabag 2.4 gives error about loading app.php
_maybe_ because I had a custom app.php file? maybe yes, removed it.

getting error about mailer_port. some configs not updating correctly.
started container with /bin/ash, manually edited /var/www/wallabag/app/config/config.yml
to change mailer_port and mailer_encryption to static values

now getting database table creation error. probably sqlite doesn't
come pre-setup. should just connect a fake mysql instance probably

sudo docker build -t burkemw3/wallabag-chrome:dev .
sudo docker run -p 8293:80 -it --rm burkemw3/wallabag-chrome:dev /bin/ash
